# timer-countdown
This is a windows application using Visual Studio C#

I built this software for my personal purpose to help me show a countdown timer on the windows desktop, and notice me when time is over. This timer can be edited to repeat many times.

One of the helpful feature of this software is turning of the screen with or without hotkey. As a result, I can turn off the screen immediately by using hotkey when I want to go somewhere and don't let other people see things on my screen.

Shutdown and Hibernate are two other features of this software.
